ideas for clbase

- make it searchable based on query_location and location within a date range, or maybe last 3 days or something
- make a script to clean up posts that are greater than 20 days old, or maybe add it to listings populator call
- add some code to the view to make it give 'headings' to the location
- make database more unified, get rid of redundant code, make methods for different query types (php)
- any way to consolidate ajax calls? (not sure)
- make the time since post more robust, instead of just days use hours or something
- theres a problem with when the settings talbe is empty, jquery doesnt know how to add a row because table odesnt exist
- would like to be able to isolate which area to search from (would def love this to be ajax driven)
- would like to have a login system that caters to a specific persons search preferences
	+ this would require them to set up what price range they are looking for as well
	+ would also allow people to set their locations (city)
- would be nice to have some tests set up with selenium or something if we go live with this.
- change input on registration screen for location to something with prepopulated entries
- change alot of the validation in register/login to jQuery instead
- need a password reset system set up
