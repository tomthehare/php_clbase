ideas for clbase

- make it searchable based on query_location and location within a date range, or maybe last 3 days or something
- make a script to clean up posts that are greater than 20 days old, or maybe add it to listings populator call
- add some code to the view to make it give 'headings' to the location
- make database more unified, get rid of redundant code, make methods for different query types (php)
- any way to consolidate ajax calls? (not sure)
- make the time since post more robust, instead of just days use hours or something
- theres a problem with when the settings talbe is empty, jquery doesnt know how to add a row because table odesnt exist
